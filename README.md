# State Determinization Experiments

Experiments, results, and their evaluation of the 5th Chapter of my Dissertation "Prediction-Based Search for Autonomous Game-Playing" submitted at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg.

- Hearthstone Dissertation: C# Experiments of the agent's game-playing performance
- Python Scripts: Card Sequence Models (bigrams) and Clustering-based card prediction (Fuzzy Decks)

Since I signed that I am not publishing the content of my thesis prior to its submission, this readme is rather short but will be extended after publication of my thesis. Until now the Github-Repository should allow for a detailed review of performed experiments and their raw results. Figures, tables, and a more detailed description will be added later in 2020.
